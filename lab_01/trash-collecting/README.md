# Trash-collecting robot problem
Given a maze with robot R and trashes T,
the goal for the robot is to collect all the trashes walking the shortest route possible.

## Usage
`./run.sh <input_path> <approach_number>`
        
Approaches:
1. greedily to the closest trash using BFS
2. optimally using A* with minimum spanning tree heuristic

Sample call:
`./run.sh test/2.txt 2`

## Approaches

### Greedy BFS - aprroach 1
A state space is just the input encoded as a graph.
A state in the state space is a position of the robot.

Using the BFS, the robot finds the nearest trash and goes for it.
This process is repeated until all trashes are collected.

### Optimal BFS (A* with zero heuristic) - not implemented
A state in a state space is a position of the robot AND a list of remaining trashes.

Using the BFS in this state space, the robot can find the optimal solution but many states are opened.

### Optimal A* with minimum spanning tree heuristic - approach 2
A state in a state space is a position of the robot AND a list of remaining trashes
(same as in the Optimal BFS approach).

The optimal solution is found as well but with much less states opened.

Because I use a custom A* implementation, there is no need to hold the whole state space in memory
(which would be O(|maze| * |T|!) states).
There is only an `opened` collection of opened states, which is relavitely small thanks to the heuristic.

Distances between each pair of trashes and between the robot and trashes are computed using Dijkstra algorithm (`nx.shortest_path` library implementation) (Since |T| << |maze|, the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm would probably take longer.) and the minimum spanning tree is constructed using Kruskal algorithm (`nx.minimum_spanning_tree` library implementation).
